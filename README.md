# CSE499 ♥️ EEG BRAINWAVE ABNORMALITIES DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING AND EXPLAINABLE AI

The basic scenario of the condition that impacts us to design the system- If a person lives in a rural location and suffers from any type of brain injury caused by various types of behaviors, he or she must seek treatment in an urban area hospital. When he/she arrives at the hospital, he/she must collect the EEG report and show it to the doctor who understands how to determine if the report waves are odd. And human error could also happen here. If there is any type of anomaly among the waves, our system will step in. This lowered the amount of labor and the time required to solve issues in the brain. And also, we are overcoming the limitation of detection method using machine learning or three-dimensional CNN deep learning method by using Explainable AI with CNN and transfer learning.
